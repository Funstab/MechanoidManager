# Mechanoid Manager

## Description

**Mechanoid Manager** is a quality-of-life mod that provides you with full control over mechanoid raids and incidents. Easily enable or disable mechanoids, and adjust the frequency of mechanoid encounters to suit your gameplay style.

The reason I made this mod is that many players want the ability to disable mechanoids mid-game. While you can disable mechanoids before starting a new game, there is no way to do so during an ongoing game. This mod allows you to disable mechanoids or modify their frequency mid-save.

## Features

- Enable or disable mechanoid raids and incidents with a single toggle.
- Adjust the frequency of mechanoid encounters using a simple slider in the mod settings.
- Settings can be configured mid-game, instantly applying changes to mechanoid activity.
- **Easier Mechanoids Option**:
  - **Reduced Health**: Mechanoids' health is reduced by 2.
  - **Reduced Armor**: Both sharp and blunt armor ratings of mechanoids are reduced by 2.
  - **Reduced Damage**: Melee damage dealt by mechanoids is reduced by 2.
  - **Increased Cooldown**: Melee attack cooldown of mechanoids is increased by 2.
  - **Flammability**: Mechanoids are now flammable, while their buildings (except turrets) remain non-flammable.
  - **Reduced Turret Range**: The range of mechanoid turrets is reduced.
  - **Reduced Shield Generator Range**: The effective range of mechanoid shield generators is reduced.

## How to Use
