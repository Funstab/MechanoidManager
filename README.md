# Mechanoid Manager

## Description

**Mechanoid Manager** is a quality-of-life mod that provides you with full control over mechanoid raids and incidents. Easily enable or disable mechanoids, and adjust the frequency of mechanoid encounters to suit your gameplay style.

The reason I made this mod is that many players want the ability to disable mechanoids mid-game. While you can disable mechanoids before starting a new game, there is no way to do so during an ongoing game. This mod allows you to disable mechanoids or modify their frequency mid-save.

## Features

- Enable or disable mechanoid raids and incidents with a single toggle.
- Adjust the frequency of mechanoid encounters using a simple slider in the mod settings.
- Settings can be configured mid-game, instantly applying changes to mechanoid activity.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version from the [Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3303711952) page.
2. Activate the mod in the RimWorld mod menu.

## How to Use

1. Go to the mod settings in the main menu or in-game.
2. Use the checkbox to enable or disable mechanoids entirely.
3. Use the slider to set the desired frequency of mechanoid encounters from 0% (no mechanoids) to 200% (double frequency).
4. The mod will automatically adjust the mechanoid incidents based on your settings.

## Compatibility

This mod should be compatible with most other mods. If you encounter any issues, please report them.
